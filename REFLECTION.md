1) I learned how to use github but I struggled to understand how to connect github and git and keep it intertwined alongside the lesson plan.
2) The most confusing part was doing things on the Git side, but I found github relatively straightforward and easy.
3) I know that developers use git to provide open sourced code to the internet that could benefit future coders to utilize but also it can help the developer figure out new ways around their code with a fresh lens.
4) This could help with sharing the projects and keeping everything together on a cloud based system.
